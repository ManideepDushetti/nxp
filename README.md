## Installation

To set up this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd nxp

## Running PHP Code with XAMPP

To execute PHP code using XAMPP, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Download and Install XAMPP**:
   - Visit the [official XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and download the version compatible with your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. It's recommended to keep the default installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp` on Windows).

2. **Start Apache and MySQL Servers**:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Click the "Start" button next to "Apache" to initiate the Apache server.
   - Click the "Start" button next to "MySQL" to initiate the MySQL server.

3. **Set Up Your PHP Project**:
   - Navigate to the `htdocs` directory within your XAMPP installation folder. This directory serves as the root for your web applications. For example, on Windows, it might be located at `C:\xampp\htdocs`.
   - Create a new folder within `htdocs` for your project. For instance:
     ```bash
     C:\xampp\htdocs\nxp
     ```
   - Copy all the files from the cloned `nxp` repository into this newly created folder.

4. **Create a PHP File**:
   - Using a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code), create a new PHP file named `index.php` within your project folder.
   - Add the following sample PHP code to the file:
     ```php
     <?php
     echo "Hello, World!";
     ?>
     ```
   - Save the file.

5. **Access Your PHP Application via a Web Browser**:
   - Open your preferred web browser.
   - In the address bar, type the following URL to access your PHP application:
     ```
     http://localhost/nxp/index.php
     ```
   - Press Enter. You should see the output of your PHP code, which in this case will display: `Hello, World!`
