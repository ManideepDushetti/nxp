## ABSTRACT

#### In engineering, many instruments which are costly and of short-term

#### use are wasted after their usage. So we need a steady platform between

#### all the years and branches of NIT AP so that there will be no problems

#### such as the wastage of money.

#### On this platform, students can buy and sell anything from calcito

#### apron with their juniors and seniors for low prices than MRP which will

#### be profitable for both, and juniors will be happy to buy instruments that

#### are of good quality and can be bought cheaper than a new one.


## INTRODUCTION

#### College life is an exciting time, full of new experiences and opportunities. For

#### many students, it is also a time when they need to be mindful of their

#### spending and make the most of their resources. One way to save money

#### while still getting the things you need is by using a second-hand buying and

#### selling platform. These platforms provide a convenient and affordable way to

#### buy and sell pre-owned items, making it easier for students to manage their

#### finances.

#### This website helps students to save money, reduce waste, and access a

#### wide range of items at affordable prices. The website creates a platform

#### where anyone can create an account to buy and sell a product and also bid in

#### an auction where an active auction is available.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

#### College students often face financial constraints and are

#### increasingly concerned about environmental sustainability. However,

#### there is a lack of convenient and reliable second-hand buying and

#### selling platforms specifically tailored to the needs of college students.

#### This project aims to develop a user-friendly and secure platform that

#### facilitates the exchange of second-hand goods among college

#### students, providing an affordable and sustainable alternative to

#### traditional consumption patterns.
